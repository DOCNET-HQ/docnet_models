## 🩺 Overview

This repository contains trained and experimental AI models developed by the **DOCNET AI Research Team**.  
Each model targets a specific medical condition and is organized in its own directory for clarity and modularity.

### Current Models

| Model Name | Description | Primary Use |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 🧠 **brain_tumor_predictor** | Deep learning model for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. | Early detection and diagnosis support for neurological patients. |
| 🦠 **malaria_predictor** | Image-based CNN model trained on blood smear images to detect malaria parasites. | Fast and accurate malaria screening in remote clinics. |
| 🩹 **skin_cancer_predictor** | Model trained on dermatological images to identify various types of skin lesions and cancers. | Teledermatology and skin health assessment. |
